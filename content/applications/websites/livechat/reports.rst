View and filter options
=======================

On any Odoo report, the view and filter options vary, depending on what data is being analyzed,
measured, and grouped. See below for additional information on the available views for the *Live
Chat* reports.

.. note::
   The :ref:`Sessions History <livechat/sessions-history>` report is **only** available in *list
   view*.

Pivot view
----------

The *pivot* view presents data in an interactive manner. The :ref:`Session Statistics
<livechat/session-statistics>` and :ref:`Operator Analysis <livechat/operator-analysis>` reports are
available in pivot view.

The pivot view can be accessed on a report by selecting the :guilabel:`grid icon` at the top-right
of the screen.

To add a group to a row or column to the pivot view, click the :guilabel:`âž• (plus sign)` next to
:guilabel:`Total`, and then select one of the groups. To remove one, click the :guilabel:`âž– (minus
sign)` and de-select the appropriate option.

Graph view
----------

The *graph* view presents data in either a *bar*, *line*, or *pie* chart. The :ref:`Session
Statistics <livechat/session-statistics>` and :ref:`Operator Analysis <livechat/operator-analysis>`
reports are available in graph view.

Switch to the graph view by selecting the :guilabel:`line chart icon` at the top-right of the
screen. To switch between the different charts, select the *related icon* at the top-left of the
chart, while in graph view.

.. tip::
   Both the bar chart and line chart can utilize the stacked view option. This presents two or more
   groups of data on top of each other, instead of next to each other, making it easier to compare
   data.
